					<h4>Below is just dummy content-- I have yet to write out my own bio</h4>

				<div class="paragraph">
					<p>
						I currently am working as a UX Engineer at GoDaddy, which is where my passion for design and
						development converge. See my previous work history on LinkedIn. Outside of work I have a
						beautiful wife and cat (obviously). I am also working on a few side projects including
						Investment Calculator (a simple tool to teach people about investing) and dayofthedead.holiday.
						Currently I am not accepting freelance work, but I'd love to get coffee and get to know you, so
						donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.

					<h6 class="sub-heading">UI/UX DESIGN</h6>
					<p>
						UI/UX involves planning and iterating a site's structure and layout. Once the proper information
						architecture is in place, I design the visual layer to create a beautiful user experience.
					</p>

					<h6 class="sub-heading sub-heading-margin">FRONT END DEVELOPMENT</h6>
					<p>
						Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website. Using HTML, CSS , and
						Javascript, I build fast, interactive websites. This also may include integrating a CMS.
					</p>

					<h6 class="sub-heading sub-heading-margin">BRAND & COLLATERAL DESIGN</h6>
					<p>
						While most of my attention is on interactive projects, I do branding and collateral from time to
						time. This includes logo design, business cards, and other printed materials.
